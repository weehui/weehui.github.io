    This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) explains how we collect, use, store, share, and protect your information when you use <strong>3D-PaiLiTi</strong> (the “App”) and related services, as well as the rights and choices you have. We comply with Google Play’s <em>User Data</em> and <em>Data Safety</em> disclosure requirements, including transparent disclosures for sensitive permissions such as camera, microphone, and media.

    <li><strong>Camera / Photos (with consent)</strong>: images or videos you capture or select for 3D generation / avatar creation; treated as personal and sensitive data and processed only for the intended feature.</li>
    <li><strong>Third-party SDK data</strong>: necessary telemetry collected by integrated SDKs (e.g., Firebase, AdMob) for analytics, crash reporting, ads delivery, or push notifications.</li>
