  <h1>3D-PaiLiTi Privacy Policy</h1>
  <div class="meta">
    Version: v1.0 ｜ Effective date: <strong>2025-10-20</strong> ｜ Last updated: <strong>2025-10-20</strong> ｜ Platforms: Android (and optionally iOS)
  </div>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) explains how we collect, use, store, share, and protect your information when you use <strong>3D-PaiLiTi</strong> (the “App”) and related services, as well as the rights and choices you have regarding your information.
    We comply with Google Play’s User Data and Data Safety disclosure requirements, including transparent disclosures for sensitive permissions such as camera/microphone/photos & videos.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>Depending on the features you use, we may collect the following categories of information (which may include personal and device information):</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account & identity information</strong>: e.g., nickname, avatar, email address, third-party sign-in identifiers (e.g., Google or Facebook sign-in).</li>
    <li><strong>Device & log information</strong>: device model, OS, app version, language, network type, crash logs and diagnostics for reliability and troubleshooting.</li>
    <li><strong>Transactions & purchases</strong>: when you make in-app purchases (IAP), we receive purchase tokens, order IDs, and similar data from Google Play Billing for verification and after-sales support. We do not handle your full payment card details.</li>
    <li><strong>Camera / Photos (when enabled)</strong>: when you capture or upload images for features such as 3D model generation / scanning / avatar upload, we access the camera or media library with your permission. Photos and videos are treated as personal and sensitive user data. We process them only to the extent necessary for the intended feature and follow the principle of data minimization.</li>
    <li><strong>Third-party SDK data</strong>: to enable analytics, crash diagnostics, ads delivery, or push messaging, third-party SDKs may collect necessary data within the scope of this Policy and your consent (see “Third-Party Services” below).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide, maintain, and improve the App and its features (including camera/media processing, rendering, search, and download management).</li>
    <li>Account management, cloud sync, and purchase verification (e.g., using the Google Play Android Developer API).</li>
    <li>Troubleshooting and security protection (e.g., crash analytics and abuse detection).</li>
    <li>Provide content or services tailored to your preferences where applicable.</li>
    <li>Conduct lawful and compliant statistics/analysis with necessary permissions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Permissions and Purposes</h2>
  <p>We request system permissions only when necessary for specific features and only access them after you grant consent. You can revoke permissions anytime in the device’s Settings → Privacy/Permissions.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Camera (android.permission.CAMERA)</strong>: used for shooting/scanning/live preview/generating materials. Features that require the camera are disabled if permission is denied. For more sensitive data (e.g., photos/videos), we adhere to data minimization.</li>
    <li><strong>Read media (e.g., READ_MEDIA_IMAGES / system photo picker)</strong>: used to select/upload images or videos from the device. We prefer the official, more granular approaches to reduce access scope.</li>
    <li><strong>Microphone (optional)</strong>: used when recording or audio input is needed.</li>
    <li><strong>Network</strong>: used for server communication, download/upload, and authorization checks.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Storage, Retention, and Security</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Storage location</strong>: data may be stored on Firebase (asia-southeast1) servers and backups.</li>
    <li><strong>Retention</strong>: we retain data for the minimum period necessary to fulfill the purposes described, unless longer retention is required by law or for dispute resolution.</li>
    <li><strong>Security measures</strong>: we use transport encryption, access control, and logging/auditing to protect data security; however, no online service can guarantee 100% security.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. How We Share Information</h2>
  <p>We do not sell your personal information to unrelated third parties. We share information only in the following circumstances:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Service providers / SDKs</strong> (only as necessary): e.g., crash analytics, performance monitoring, push messaging, advertising, and measurement.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal compliance</strong>: to fulfill legal obligations, comply with court/regulatory requests, or protect user and public safety.</li>
    <li><strong>Business transfers</strong>: in the event of mergers, acquisitions, or reorganizations, provided the successor entity remains bound by this Policy or obtains your consent.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Advertising and Analytics (if applicable)</h2>
  <p>
    If the App displays ads (e.g., Google AdMob) or uses analytics tools, partners may collect device identifiers, advertising IDs (e.g., AAID/IDFA), and impression/click events via SDKs for ad delivery and performance measurement, subject to Google publisher policies (AdMob follows the AdSense policy framework). You can reset your advertising ID or limit ad personalization at the OS level.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    We follow applicable laws and platform policies on protecting minors’ information. If the product targets children or includes child-directed content, we apply stricter collection limits and obtain parental consent where required.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Access, rectification, deletion</strong>: you may contact us or use in-app options to manage data associated with your account.</li>
    <li><strong>Permission management</strong>: you may revoke camera/microphone/media permissions in system settings at any time; related features will become unavailable after revocation.</li>
    <li><strong>Personalized ads</strong>: you can reset your advertising ID or limit personalized ads at the system level.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>9. Cross-Border Transfers (if applicable)</h2>
  <p>
    Where data is transferred across borders, we will comply with applicable laws and implement appropriate safeguards.
  </p>

  <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Policy from time to time. For material changes, we will notify you in-app or in a prominent place on this page. Your continued use after updates signifies that you have read, understood, and agreed to the updated Policy.
  </p>
