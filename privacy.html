    <li><strong>Camera / Photos (with consent)</strong>: images or videos you capture or select for 3D generation / avatar creation; treated as personal and sensitive data and processed only for the intended feature.</li>
    <li><strong>Third-party SDK data</strong>: necessary telemetry collected by integrated SDKs (e.g., Firebase, AdMob) for analytics, crash reporting, ads delivery, or push notifications.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide, maintain, and improve core features (3D generation, upload, rendering, downloads).</li>
    <li>Account login and sync; verify purchases and entitlement.</li>
    <li>Troubleshooting and diagnostics (crash analytics, performance monitoring).</li>
    <li>Security protection and abuse detection.</li>

    <li>Comply with applicable laws and regulatory requirements.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Permissions and Purposes</h2>
